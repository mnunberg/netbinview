NETBINVIEW
----------

Simple utilities for converting to and from common network formats.
This is often helpful when looking inside something like strace or
a packet dump and trying to reinterpret an error code or similar.

Provided are:

* ntohs
* ntohl
* htons
* htonl

These are all symlinked to the `netbinview` binary. The commands do what you
think they do.

I hope to add more in the future
